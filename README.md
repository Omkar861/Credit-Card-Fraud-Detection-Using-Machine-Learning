# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset of credit card transactions to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to build an effective fraud detection model.


# Key Features
1. Dataset:
  The project uses a public dataset, such as the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains real transaction data from European cardholders in 2013.
  The dataset includes features extracted using PCA to ensure privacy and has an imbalanced class distribution.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   Handling class imbalance using techniques like undersampling, oversampling (SMOTE), or weighted loss functions.
   Scaling features using StandardScaler to normalize the data.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Visualization of transaction distributions.
  Examination of correlations and feature importance.
  Insights into fraud patterns.

4. Model Building:
  Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), or Neural Networks.
  Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
  Use of ensemble learning methods for improved performance.

5. Evaluation Metrics:
  Evaluation based on metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
  Confusion matrix visualization to assess model performance.
6. Deployment:
  Optionally deploying the model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
  Including an interactive dashboard with Streamlit for transaction classification visualization.
